# Privacy Policy for Inspiration Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** January 11, 2025

## Overview

Inspiration is a Chrome browser extension that displays motivational quotes from top entrepreneurs on your new tab page. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

## What the Extension Does

1. **Random Background Images**: Upon installation, the extension fetches one random background image from picsum.photos and stores it locally in your browser's storage (chrome.storage.local) for offline use.

2. **Quotes Display**: The extension displays pre-packaged motivational quotes that are included in the extension itself. No external requests are made to fetch quotes.

3. **Local Time Display**: The current time is calculated locally on your device using the Luxon library. No time data is sent to external servers.

## Permissions Used

- **storage**: Used to save the background image locally in your browser
- **host_permissions (picsum.photos)**: Required only during installation to fetch the initial background image

## Third-Party Services

- **picsum.photos**: Used only once during installation to fetch a random wallpaper image. No user data is sent to this service.

## Data Storage

All data (background image) is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API. This data never leaves your device.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
